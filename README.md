# External barriers
External barriers encompass a wide set of factors, ranging from the cost of implementation
(and other economic factors) to the lack of support and guidance, from hindrances linked to
the institutional framework and the verification/registration process to the lack of market
recognition, and so on.

Most of the evidence gathered within the review of existing literature on these issues
regards the relevance of economic factors, scarce customer awareness/interest and lack of
recognition by public institutions as factors hindering the will of organizations to adopt an
EMS and in particular a formal EMS such as ISO 14001 or EMAS .
The cost of implementation, for instance, seems to be a relevant barrier, especially for SMEs
where financial resources are more limited (Hillary 1999, Biondi et al. 2000).
SMEs certainly have to struggle against their lack of resources and fill a cultural gap as
regards environmental matters. At a first glance, the main problem for SMEs seems to be
that of finding money to invest in the improvement of environmental performance.
Therefore, costs connected with the implementation of an EMS and with the adoption of a
voluntary scheme could represent a first kind of barrier for SMEs.
The widespread agreement over the importance of such a barrier is confirmed by many
studies, like a survey on the uptake of EMAS and ISO 14001 (ISO, 2005) showing how the
lack of financial resources (33%) and the costs of certification (23%) are among main barriers
for the implementation of an EMS.
In detail, we can distinguish the financial costs basically in three categories: costs relating to
the necessary technical measures for guaranteeing the improvement of environmental
performance, costs relating to the EMS implementation and costs to be sustained for
obtaining a third party certification.
As to the first cost category, we refer, only in the case of ISO 14001 and EMAS, to the costs
that many participating enterprises have to face in order to comply with the environmental
regulations that is a requirement of both schemes. Moreover, in the adoption of an EMS,
most of SMEs’ financial efforts connected with “technical measures” regard the costs of
equipment and the cost relating to plants management, control and maintenance. The
commitment to continuous improvement implies that plant investments should not be over
with the EMAS registration or the ISO 14001 certification, but instead means that
environmental improvement must, from that moment on, be considered in all the decisions
regarding investment and maintenance scheduling.
Costs sustained by the SMEs in structuring their EMS represents another significant
financial effort. For instance Delmas (2002) states that “the annual cost of maintaining ISO 
14001 is a more important constraint than are design and registration costs”; this might be
an explanation of the “crisis” of certifications in some countries characterizing recent years,
as many organizations drop EMSs as costs overweight benefits. These costs are often due to
the lack of expertise and trained personnel capable of performing the necessary
measurement and analyses, which implies the need to rely on external technicians and
consultancies. Cost of management time is another relevant cost whereas costs connected
with personnel information and training as well as with environmental auditing (reported
as specific items) were not considered relevant. It is important to highlight that the EMS
“degree of maturity” is a relevant variable which most influences the steps which the
enterprise will have to take, and consequently the additional costs. A production site where
a management system has already been structured and a systematic auditing activity is
regularly performed (but this rarely is the case of an SME) will obviously have considerably
lower costs compared to a site which has still to take some of the organisational-managerial
steps required by EMAS or ISO.
Finally, we consider the financial costs strictly connected with the adhesion to one of the
formal voluntary standards such as ISO 14001 and EMAS. 
The costs relating to EMAS registration, for example, are generally low, although this
depends on each national Competent Body. In some countries the cost depends on site
dimension and turnover, representing a positive attempt to knock down a financial barrier
for SMEs. For example, in Italy the cost varies from 50 €, for small firms, to 1500€ , for large
firms.
On the one hand, to give an idea of the financial resources required, we can mention the
“EMAS toolkit” (European Commission, 2000), which provides figures with the average
expenditures for different size-categories of organisations:
€ 10,000 for very small companies (< 10 employees)
€ 20,000 for small companies (< 50 employees)
€ 35,000 for medium companies (50 <250 employees)
€ 50,000 for large companies (> 250 employees)
On the other hand, studies on EMS costs (Hamschmidt & Dyllick 2001, Milieu Ltd & Risk
and Policy Analysis Ltd, 2009) suggest that the above mentioned figures might be
underestimated. The discrepancies in the outcome of different investigations are due to
many factors, not least the fact that most organizations do not have a system for the
accounting of environmental costs. The table below collected evidence from previous
studies on the costs of EMAS implementation in different countries.
